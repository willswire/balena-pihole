## Forked from klutchell/balena-pihole
I've simplified Kyle's code down to a single .yml file, which pulls in the default docker image from pihole's official repo.

I removed unbound/other upstream fluff that I didn't need for my setup at home.

Continuing on with a modified README to suit...

# balena-pihole

If you're looking for a way to quickly and easily get up and running with a Pi-hole device for your home network, this is the project for you.

This project is a [balenaCloud](https://www.balena.io/cloud) stack with the following services:

* [Pi-hole](https://hub.docker.com/r/pihole/pihole/)

balenaCloud is a free service to remotely manage and update your Raspberry Pi through an online dashboard interface, as well as providing remote access to the Pi-hole web interface without any additional configuration.

## Getting Started

To get started you'll first need to sign up for a free balenaCloud account and flash your device.

<https://www.balena.io/docs/learn/getting-started>

## Deployment

Once your account is set up, deployment is carried out by downloading the project and pushing it to your device either via Git or the balena CLI.

### Application Environment Variables

Application envionment variables apply to all services within the application, and can be applied fleet-wide to apply to multiple devices.

|Name|Value|Purpose|
|---|---|---|
|`TZ`|E.g. `America/Toronto`, find a [list of all timezone values here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).|To inform both `pihole` and `unbound` services of the timezone in your location, in order to set times and dates within the applications correctly.|

### Service Variables

Service variables are set to apply only to a specific service within the application, but can also be set to apply to all devices in the fleet.

|Service|Name|Value|Purpose|
|---|---|---|---|
|`pihole`|`DNS1`|`1.1.1.1`|To tell Pi-hole where to forward DNS requests that aren’t blocked. We’re using the Cloudflare DNS servers here but you can specify your own.|
|`pihole`|`DNS2`|`1.0.0.1`|Secondary DNS server - see above.|
|`pihole`|`INTERFACE`|`eth0`|We set this to `eth0` to indicate we want DNSMASQ to listen on the ethernet interface of the Raspberry Pi. If you're connecting to your network with WiFi replace this with `wlan0`|
|`pihole`|`ServerIP`|_[external device ip]_|Set this to the local IP address of your Pi-hole device to enable full ad-blocking. [Blocking modes are explained here](https://docs.pi-hole.net/ftldns/blockingmode/). `0.0.0.0` provides unspecified IP blocking.
|`pihole`|`WEBPASSWORD`|`mysecretpassword`|__Optional__ password for accessing the web-based interface of Pi-hole - you won’t be able to access the admin panel without defining a password here.
